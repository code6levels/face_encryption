Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.

She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out".

My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.


15­th February 2006
I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled.

I went to the college and was dying to know more about her. After many searches and investigations i found out that she was from St. Peter’s college. She was a Mass Communication student and her name was Antra Mahapatra.
At 1:30 pm I was sitting at her college parking area, yup obviously to see her. She came and sat on her pink shiny vespa and went away. She did not even see me but my tricky mind had got one idea to make her notice me.

16th February 2006
Now when I knew her departure time, I reached the parking at 12:30pm and with the help of my friends deliberately placed bikes around her vespa. We cleared the parking. Only I was left there and I started waiting for Antra. She came at 1:45p.m. Her green overcoat was looking gorgeous. Seeing her scooty stuck amidst the bikes her eyebrows rose a bit and strain could easily be noticed in her forehead. She looked awesome. She started looking here and there. Her sight caught me. She came to me and said, "Excuse me" I said, “Yes". She said," my scooty{pointing to her pink vespa} is stuck, can you help me out". She dint know I was waiting for this only since two hours;) I instantly said yes. Okay I couldn't control my excitement ! I removed the bikes and made way for her scooty. I was about to start the conversation. I said, “You remember we met at the pu………” she dint even gave a shit, just sat on her scooty and went away. My idea dint work.

17thFebruary 2006
I went to the college. My face clearly showed me agony and my friends had made out that yesterday’s plan had failed. My friend Amol, who was from her college had informed me that she was very fond of reading and every Saturday she used to go to the British Library to read books. The next day was a Saturday.

Valentine's Day! Probably the most perfect day to meet love....the day when i first saw her.
I, with four of my college friends Shekhar, Amol, Anant and Viren, was at the Retro Pub, enjoying the Valentine's Day party. It was 1:30 and there were no signs of end of the night.
As I was going to the counter to order vodka for me and my friends, I encountered a girl... no perhaps the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. I reached the counter but was still looking at her. She was arguing with her friend and may be i did a sin... mm... I 0verheard their conversation. She said she hated alcohol and would never taste it. I ordered five glasses of vodka. Meanwhile she came to counter irritated. She sat on a chair. She ordered a mock tail for. I deliberately replaced my glass of vodka with her. She drank it and asked the waiter to prepare one more. She liked it a lot. She ordered six glasses and each time she praised more the taste of the drink. Oh Gosh! She was filled. She went straight up to the stage and in very loud and in her's girly shrill voice started singing, "thodi si jo pi li hai chori toh nahi ki hai......" She went on and on and danced along. Everyone over there burst into laughter but I was just starring her. Her purple gown, purple color had never fascinated me this much, her silver earrings, golden wrist watch and her little pouch, everything was just magical. Her smudged kajal and tangled locks clearly showed she had danced beyond her limits. I experienced something which is called love at first sight. Her friends came and took her away but she did not stop her singing. The rest of the night i was only thinking of her.
